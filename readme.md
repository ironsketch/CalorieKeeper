This app is SUPER simple because I got tired of ads and payments and all that jazz. I just wanted to type my food and the calories and that is it.

What you can do

- Add an entry
- Edit the date (So you can post in the past and future)
- Delete an entry (I am lazy, don't edit it just recreate...)
- Double tap to delete
- If you tapped ONLY once and no longer want to delete, long press to undo
